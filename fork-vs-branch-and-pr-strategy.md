In Terraform and general DevOps practices, choosing between a **Forking** or **Branching** strategy, and having a well-defined **Pull Request (PR)** strategy, is essential for managing infrastructure as code (IaC). Here's a detailed comparison and PR strategy suggestion.

---

### **Fork vs Branching**

#### 1. **Branching Strategy**
With the branching model, developers work within the **same repository**, creating branches off the main (or master) branch to implement their changes.

**Key Features:**
- **Same repository:** All contributors use a shared repository, creating branches for specific features, bug fixes, or environment configurations.
- **Local branches:** Developers create branches like `feature/<feature-name>`, `bugfix/<bug-description>`, `env/<environment>`, etc., to isolate their work.
- **Pull Requests (PRs):** Branches are merged back into the main branch through PRs.

**Benefits:**
- **Collaboration:** Easy for teams to collaborate within a shared codebase.
- **Consistency:** Since all branches exist within the same repo, it's easier to maintain consistency and visibility.
- **Simpler CI/CD:** Integrations with CI/CD pipelines are easier since all branches are part of the same repository.
- **Faster iterations:** Working with branches allows for quick iteration and direct feedback loops on code reviews.

**Challenges:**
- **Permission control:** All team members have write access to the repo, which might require strict governance to prevent accidental merges.
- **Single source of truth:** Everyone works in the same repo, so there's more risk if mistakes are made or conflicts arise.

**Best for:**
- **Small to medium-sized teams** or companies where it's important to have a unified view of the codebase.
- When **tighter collaboration** between developers and infrastructure engineers is needed.

#### 2. **Forking Strategy**
Forking involves **creating a copy** of the repository to the contributor's personal or team's space. Developers work on their fork, and changes are proposed back to the original repository via PRs.

**Key Features:**
- **Separate repositories:** Each developer or team has their own fork (a copy of the original repository), working independently until they create a PR to merge changes back.
- **PR workflow:** Developers raise PRs from their forks into the main repository to contribute their work.

**Benefits:**
- **Isolation:** Perfect for open-source or large projects where contributors work in isolation without affecting the original repo.
- **Granular control:** Maintainers of the original repo have complete control over what gets merged, adding an extra layer of security and quality checks.
- **No direct repo access:** Contributors don’t need direct access to the main repository, which is useful in situations with many external contributors (e.g., open-source projects).

**Challenges:**
- **Overhead:** Requires more overhead in managing multiple forks, syncing them with the main repository, and ensuring changes aren’t stale.
- **Complexity:** Forking introduces more complexity in managing CI/CD pipelines, code reviews, and versioning across forks.
- **Slower collaboration:** For internal teams, this can slow down collaboration since each developer/team operates in isolation.

**Best for:**
- **Open-source projects** or projects with external contributors who don’t need direct access to the main repository.
- Large teams or companies where each team manages a different segment of the infrastructure and uses the main repo as a "source of truth" without direct access.

### **PR Strategy (Pull Request Strategy)**

Regardless of whether you're using branching or forking, an effective **Pull Request (PR)** strategy is crucial for managing code quality, collaboration, and feedback loops.

#### 1. **Small, Focused PRs**
- **Avoid large PRs** that include many unrelated changes. Small PRs with clear objectives make it easier for reviewers to understand the scope and potential impacts.
- Example: Submit a PR for adding a new Terraform module, not for adding the module and simultaneously refactoring the infrastructure.

#### 2. **Code Reviews and Approvals**
- Set up a **mandatory code review process**, where at least one or two reviewers must approve the PR before it can be merged.
- For critical infrastructure changes, consider having **senior engineers or leads** as mandatory approvers.
- Use **review tools** that allow for inline commenting, suggestions, and discussions.

#### 3. **CI/CD Integration for Automated Validation**
- Automate the validation of Terraform code with **pre-merge checks**, such as:
  - Running `terraform plan` to show the impact of the changes.
  - Linting and formatting with `terraform fmt` and `tflint`.
  - Security checks with tools like **Checkov** or **TerraScan**.
  - Running integration tests on infrastructure provisioning (e.g., using **Terratest**).

#### 4. **Environment Branching or Tags**
- Use **branches or tags** for different environments, such as `dev`, `staging`, and `prod`, to maintain separation of environments.
- For example:
  - Develop features in a `feature/<feature-name>` branch.
  - Merge changes into `dev` for testing and validation.
  - Promote to `staging` after review.
  - Merge to `prod` once tested in staging.
  
#### 5. **Merge Strategies**
- Use **Squash merges** or **rebase** merges to keep a clean commit history.
  - **Squash merge** condenses all commits into one, creating a cleaner history.
  - **Rebase merge** applies your branch commits on top of the main branch, avoiding merge commits but maintaining individual commit history.
  
#### 6. **Tagging and Versioning**
- Use **semantic versioning** (`v1.0.0`, `v1.1.0`, etc.) for releases and tag them on the `main` branch to track specific versions of your Terraform infrastructure.

#### 7. **Pre-Merge Approvals for Production**
- Require additional approvals for changes to critical environments like **production**. This could include a change advisory board (CAB) or a multi-level approval process.
- For production merges, consider implementing **manual triggers** to promote from staging, ensuring all necessary tests are passed.

#### 8. **Use Draft PRs for Early Feedback**
- Encourage developers to create **draft PRs** when their work is in progress. This allows early feedback without requiring full review, helping to avoid rework later on.

#### 9. **PR Template**
- Provide a **PR template** that includes sections like:
  - **What:** Describe the change.
  - **Why:** Explain the reason for the change.
  - **Testing:** Mention how it has been tested (e.g., running `terraform plan` or applying in a dev environment).
  - **Impact:** Potential impact on existing infrastructure, services, or teams.

### **Fork vs Branching with PR Strategy**

- **Branching** works well with small to medium teams, internal projects, or environments with fast-paced collaboration. Pair it with the PR strategies like small, focused PRs, CI/CD validation, and approval processes for smooth operations.
  
- **Forking** works best for open-source or large, decentralized projects where direct access control is important. In this case, maintaining a rigorous PR strategy (including code reviews, tagging, and validation processes) is key to ensuring only well-tested and reviewed code is merged.

### Conclusion
- **Branching** is preferable for most internal teams using Terraform due to ease of collaboration and management.
- **Forking** is better suited for more complex or open-source projects where contributions come from external users or teams with strict access controls.
