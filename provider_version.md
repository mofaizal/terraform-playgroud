## How to declare provider version in the compatibility with all versions

Terraform provider version constraints help define compatible versions of the provider. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the differences in each version constraint syntax you provided:

### 1. `>= 3.5.0`
   - **Meaning**: Allows **any version** of the provider that is **3.5.0 or newer**.
   - **Examples of allowed versions**: `3.5.0`, `3.6.0`, `4.0.0`, `5.0.0`, etc.
   - **Usage**: This is useful when you want to ensure compatibility with all versions from `3.5.0` onward.

### 2. `~> 3.5.0`
   - **Meaning**: Allows patch-level updates only within the `3.5.x` series.
   - **Examples of allowed versions**: `3.5.0`, `3.5.1`, `3.5.2`, but **not** `3.6.0` or `4.0.0`.
   - **Usage**: This is ideal when you want **only patch-level updates** to ensure stability within the `3.5` series while still allowing critical fixes and improvements.

### 3. `>= 3.5, < 5`
   - **Meaning**: Allows any version of the provider that is **3.5.0 or newer but less than 5.0**.
   - **Examples of allowed versions**: `3.5.0`, `3.6.0`, `4.0.0`, but **not** `5.0.0` or higher.
   - **Usage**: This is suitable when you want **all minor and patch updates** within the major version `3` and `4`, while avoiding breaking changes that might be introduced in the major version `5`.

### 4. `=> 3.5`
   - **Note**: `=>` is **not valid syntax** in Terraform for specifying version constraints. Terraform supports `>=`, `<=`, `>`, `<`, `~>`, and exact version notation (e.g., `3.5.0`).
   - **Correct version notation for this intention** would be `>= 3.5`, which would allow **any version 3.5 and above**.

### Quick Summary:
- **`>= 3.5.0`**: Allows **3.5.0 and any newer version**.
- **`~> 3.5.0`**: Allows **only patch updates in the 3.5 series** (e.g., `3.5.x`).
- **`>= 3.5, < 5`**: Allows **any version between 3.5 and up to but not including 5**.
- **`=> 3.5`**: **Not valid syntax**; likely intended to mean `>= 3.5`.

Understanding these constraints helps specify exact compatibility with Terraform providers, ensuring smooth upgrades while controlling potential breaking changes.
